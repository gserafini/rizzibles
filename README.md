### About the project
Rizzibles is a "degen-mint" style project intended to entertain, educate, and possibly reward early holders. The artist / dev behind it is GEMS, aka [@SolVisitors](https://twitter.com/SolVisitors). The project is being used to explore and test various web3 technologies (for example Metaplex Candy Machine v3, Certified Collections, Metaplex Enforced Royalties standard (pNFT), Staking, and Rewards). The cost to mint should be relatively low in order to encourage maximum participation from a wide variety of minters & traders, especially those not normally exposed to "influencer" sweetheart insider deals.

### Experimenting and building in public
We are actively learning about web3 (even after spending more than a year in the ecosystem, we still discover new things every day). One of the approaches we are trying to take with this project is "building in public." Practically speaking this entails asking questions (usually using Twitter polls) and using the results to inform our decisions.

### Values
1. _We value community._ We are doing our best to develop a base of community participants who will benefit if we succeed (win / win).
2. _We value artistic expression._ Valuing art is subjective. We've spent many hours creating and refining the art for this project. We think it's fun, quirky, has a beautiful and strange hand-drawn aesthetic, and is "family friendly" and suitable for all age ranges. Despite the "degen" association, it is art that we think can stand the test of time, and that *some* might actually use a their PFP (profile picture) on social media platforms like Twitter and Discord.
3. _We value transparency._ This document is an expample of this. As is our doxxed team, our public polls, and public proof of follow-through.
4. _We will do our best to serve our holders._ NFT projects that forget this basic concept tend to flame out and die quickly. Serving our holders can mean many things, but #1 to us it means doing our best to be honest, not make promises we can't fulful, and to try to be positive participants in this ecosystem.
5. _We value our contributors._ We will do our best to reward individuals and teams who help us succeed.

### Mint Allocations
Total mint supply is expected to be 3,333 digital collectibles living on the Solana blockchain

| Who | Total Mints Allocated | % |
| --- | ----------------------| - |
| Core Team - Marketing / giveaways / reward | 75 | 2.25% |
| [Sol Visitors IMPRINT](https://magiceden.io/marketplace/sol_visitors_imprints) holder airdrops | 425 | 12.75% |
| #rizzbassador VIP (guaranteed allocations) - max 5 mints each, ~90% discount on public mint price (100 total) | 500 | 15% |
| #rizzlist allowlist (not guaranteed to mint, FCFS) - Max 3 mints each, ~40% discount on public mint price | 2,000 | 60% |
| Public mint | 333 | 10% |
|             | 3,333 | 100% |


### Glossary
- *"First 100 For-Real Followers" (#rizzbassadors)* - VIP - Guaranteed mint allocations. Real humans only, no bots (sorry!) These go to our first and most loyal community members, will have preferred pricing to mint, are expected to participate in helping promote Rizzibles to the larger community. We expect ongoing engagement during the Building phase from our #rizzbassadors. If you are not interested in that level of participation, no problem, you will still have #rizzlist / Allowlist status. We will have a "Lock-In" period to confirm final #rizzbassador list of 100 people.
- *#rizzlist* - our "allowlist" / "whitelist" for minting. Not guaranteed, FCFS. Discounted price compared to public. Will potentially be slightly overallocated since some on the list won't mint, but most who are interested should have a chance to mint their maximum allocations.

### Polls (non-binding)

Should we reveal immediately or delayed reveal after mint? **[Yes]**
